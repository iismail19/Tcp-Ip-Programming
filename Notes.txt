========================== Networking Notes ==========================

************************** Hosts **************************
- Hosts: Any machine connected to the computer network, called a host because it
	is hosting a software that can run over the network
- Host is identified by Internet Protocol (IP) address
	- Examples: Phone, Laptop, router, server
- Host name is translated into an IP address by DNS


************************** IP Address **************************
- IPv4 Address: 
	A group of 4 8 bit numbers (dotted-decimal notation)
		- 172	.	16	  .		254		.		1	
		   |		|			 |				|
		   V		V			 V				V
		10101100. 00010000.   11111110	.	00000001

		- One byte = Eight bits
		- Thirty-two bits (4 x 8), or 5 bytes


************************** The Port (Numbers) **************************
- IP Address + Port = End point
- Example: to reach a building you have a street address, then to get to a specific
	apartment it has it own unique apartment number.
	E.g.(101 W. Street Ave. apt 1)

	- Examples of end point:
		192.168.1.100:7
		192.168.1.100:16
- Total ports on a computer: 65536
- Port numbers 0 to 1023 are reserved for Operating System Usage (Well Known Ports/
	System Ports)


************************** Client Server Model **************************
 - Server and Client
 - The server must start first and it must perform and accept the operation to perform
 	except operation.
- The server will use a specific IP address and a port number = End point
- Once the server is up and running and accepting incoming connections, the client
	will start afterwards and it will try and connect with the server 
- In order to connect to the server the client would need to know the IP address and the 
	port number on which the server is listening for incoming connections.
- If the connection attempt is successful, the client and server will be able to send data
	to one another.
- What happens when an attempt to connect with the server fails?
	- An exception will occur
	- Connection attempts can fail for various reasons: 
		- Windows FireWall has a blocked either the client process or the server process
		- IP address supplied to the client is incorrect
		- The port number is wrong
		- The server process was not started at all
		- The server process was started but it crashed
		->>> In all these scenarios the client is unable to reach the server

	- Once the connection is established there is no difference between how the client
		and server operate, they both send data to each other

************************** SocketServerStarter **************************

- IPAddress ipAddress = IPAddress.Any; // this means it will listen to incoming
	connections on any availble IP-address
- Loopback IP Address = 127.0.0.1
	Or = localhost
